crud endpoints are working. lots of fake data and some bad links still on /cooking

need more workflow focused UIs
need AI integrations (including workflows)
maybe mcp for that maybe not

need to review code for clenliness and update claude.md with persistant issues

need to fix the table header vs title layout thing.

otherwise lots of great progress.

notes from claude:
We accomplished a lot together - built a complete admin-style CRUD system for all your cooking app models:

✅ 6 complete model CRUDs with consistent styling and functionality✅ Clean TypeScript implementation with proper types throughout✅
Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop✅ Relationship handling between weeks, recipes, and projects✅ Status tracking with
visual badges for planned/completed states✅ Auto-week selection using your Saturday-Friday week logic✅ Navigation improvements with
clickable section titles

The cooking app now has a solid foundation for managing recipes, projects, weeks, shops, preps, and cooks with a professional, clean
interface. Happy cooking with Sgt Chef! 👨‍🍳
