# Project Status: Cooking App Database Migration

## Completed Tasks

### Database Schema Update

- **Schema Migration**: Successfully updated Prisma schema to use simplified field structure
  - Replaced complex field names with `content_md`, `source`, `url` for Recipe/Project models
  - Changed Week model from `start_date/end_date` to `year/week` fields
  - Renamed all content fields to use `_md` suffix for markdown (e.g., `plan_md`, `outcome_md`)
  - Updated relationships to match new field structure

### API Endpoints Refactored

- **Code Structure**: Refactored all cooking API endpoints to use separate handler functions
  - `cooks.ts`: Separated into `handleGet`, `handlePost`, `handlePut` functions
  - `preps.ts`: Same refactoring approach, updated field mappings
  - `recipes.ts`: Updated to use new `content_md`, `source`, `url` fields
  - `projects.ts`: Updated to use new `content_md`, `source`, `url` fields
  - `starting-status.ts`: Updated to use `*_md` field naming convention
  - `suggest.ts`: Fixed field references and return statement issues
  - `weeks.ts`: Updated to use `year`, `week` instead of date fields

### TypeScript Compliance

- **Type Safety**: All TypeScript errors resolved
  - Fixed variable naming conflicts through function separation
  - Updated all field references to match new schema
  - Eliminated unused imports and variables
  - All files now pass `npx tsc --noEmit` check

## Current State

### Database

- Schema is up-to-date with simplified field structure
- All cooking tables are active and match API expectations
- Ready for data operations with new field names

### API Layer

- All endpoints functional with proper TypeScript types
- Consistent error handling and response formats
- Clean separation of concerns with individual handler functions

### Frontend

- Basic cooking dashboard page exists but needs data integration
- TypeScript errors resolved, ready for development

## Next Steps

### Immediate Development Priorities

1. **Data Integration**: Connect frontend to actual API data
2. **Week Management**: Implement week creation/selection functionality
3. **Core Workflows**: Build out Shop/Prep/Cook record creation flows
4. **Recipe/Project Management**: Add CRUD interfaces for recipes and projects

## Architecture Notes

### Data Flow

- Week-based organization with `year/week` identifiers
- Markdown content stored in `*_md` fields for rich formatting
- Simple foreign key relationships between Week -> Shop/Prep/Cook
- Optional relationships to Recipe/Project templates

### Field Naming Convention

- `*_md` suffix indicates markdown content fields
- `occurred_at` for when activities actually happened
- `plan_md` for planning phase content
- `outcome_md` for results/completion content

The cooking app database layer is now stable and ready for active development of user-facing features.
