10/9: cleaned up the home page.
next step: add a simple ai chat.
after that: add in context and mcp.
--
9/6: had codex make cook, plan, and shop more usable
when loading page it now shows things for this week,

small fixes: smoother loading exp, jumpy when this week is loaded
better ux on this week and browsing weeks. nubmers vs dates
when i click into a cook prep or shop and then go back i want an easy way to get back where i was
--
crud endpoints are working. lots of fake data and some bad links still on /cooking

need more workflow focused UIs
need AI integrations (including workflows)
maybe mcp for that maybe not

need to review code for clenliness and update claude.md with persistant issues

need to fix the table header vs title layout thing.

otherwise lots of great progress.

notes from claude:
We accomplished a lot together - built a complete admin-style CRUD system for all your cooking app models:

✅ 6 complete model CRUDs with consistent styling and functionality✅ Clean TypeScript implementation with proper types throughout✅
Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop✅ Relationship handling between weeks, recipes, and projects✅ Status tracking with
visual badges for planned/completed states✅ Auto-week selection using your Saturday-Friday week logic✅ Navigation improvements with
clickable section titles

The cooking app now has a solid foundation for managing recipes, projects, weeks, shops, preps, and cooks with a professional, clean
interface. Happy cooking with Sgt Chef! 👨‍🍳
