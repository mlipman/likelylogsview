milestone 1:
fetch from hackernews api a bunch of json comments
rearrange them into a tree
display parent comment on row 1
on row 2 show a few child comments, first being featured
on row 3 show children of the featured one on row 2
if you click the second choice on row 2, then row 3 updates


chuncks of work: fetch comments (not too hard)

given fake data: display it
start with a list of tweest sized comments
display them in a row.
