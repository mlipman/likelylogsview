milestone 1:
fetch from hackernews api a bunch of json comments
rearrange them into a tree
display parent comment on row 1
on row 2 show a few child comments, first being featured
on row 3 show children of the featured one on row 2
if you click the second choice on row 2, then row 3 updates


chuncks of work: fetch comments (not too hard)

given fake data: display it
start with a list of tweest sized comments
display them in a row.

main source of truth is https://github.com/mlipman/likelylogsview which auto deploys to vercel likelylogsview.
there were two replits pointing to that github (generalwebsites and likelylogs). we're going with general webistes. i will also try developing locallly, but i'll start with what was present in the genreal webistes replit.

pages: coach, index, logs, tour
index works. all its components are in the index.tsx file. hacker news stories. includes fetch and some styling.
tour kinda works. uses libraries from recharts. some weird x/y stuff, but not super important.

logs fails. imports components from components folder. that seems to rely on nextjs @ components which seem to be failing. maybe an install would fix.

gonna try `npm install shadcn-ui` got get logs working. i expect that to update my package.json with one line and package-lock.json with a lot
